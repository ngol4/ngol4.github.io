Welcome to my personal website! Feel free to explore the site to get to know me and my experiences.

A 19-year-old student at Aalto University with a strong interest in Data Science and Software Development. 

As a student, I enjoy learning new things and taking on different challenges to be better every day. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Data Science, I got a chance to satisfy my intellectual curiosity by encountering novel concepts ranging from more technology-focused such as programming, databases, and artificial intelligence to more business-focused such as economics every day. Throughout my study, I have always maintained an excellent performance, hence leading to my work as a teaching assistant for 5 computer science courses at my university. I truly love this experience as it has certainly sharpened my knowledge and developed my communication, interpersonal, and empathy skills.

I am a hard-working, highly-motivated, and goal-oriented person who believes that good discipline and ethics could take one far. In the future, I wish to leverage my knowledge, technical competency, and passion for building products that make meaningful contributions to the community. 

Having a special interest in technology and an eagerness to learn and collaborate with other people, I am open to any opportunities in data-related, software engineering, and research roles to gain hands-on experience and important skills. Please feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or send me a message at linh.l.ngo@aalto.fiâ€”I would love to have a chat!
