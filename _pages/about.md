Welcome to my personal website! Feel free to explore the site to get to know me and my experiences.

I am a driven third-year student at Aalto University with a strong interest in Data Science and Software Development. 

During my study, I have concentrated on building knowledge in programming, databases, statistics, machine learning, data science, and economics. I also have coded in Python, Scala, SQL, R, JavaScript, and C++ to implement algorithms, do analytics, and work on different projects. Besides, I have been a teaching assistant for 5 different computer science courses at my university, where I had the privilege to assist students with their learning journey by providing instructions on course materials and homework. These experiences have allowed me to sharpen my knowledge and develop my communication and listening skills. 

I am a hard-working and goal-oriented person with the belief that good discipline and ethics could take one far. In the future, I wish to leverage my knowledge, technical competency, and passion to build products that make meaningful contributions to the community.

Having a special interest in technology and an eagerness to learn and collaborate with other people, I am open to any opportunities in data-related, software engineering, and research roles to gain hands-on experience and important skills.
