# Hello! I’m Linh 👋

I enjoy working on complex data problems, building reliable systems, and turning messy data into something useful for decision-making. I’m drawn to environments where people care about quality, learning, and solving real-world problems with data.

I’m a recent Master’s graduate in Computer Science (Big Data and Large-Scale Computing) from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi). During my studies, I worked as a Developer Trainee at [OP Financial Group](https://www.op.fi), focusing on data platforms, cloud analytics, and reporting — building and migrating data pipelines, automating workflows, and developing dashboards that support engineering, cloud, and FinOps decision-making.

Previously, I worked as an Information Systems Architect Trainee at [ABB](https://global.abb), where I contributed to enterprise architecture and IT landscape mapping, and as a Teaching Assistant at [Aalto University’s Department of Computer Science](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science), supporting several of the department’s core, large-enrollment courses such as Data Structures & Algorithms, Databases for Data Science, and Machine Learning.

I’ve also worked as a Research Assistant at the [Digital Economic Security Lab](https://diesl.eu), where my Master’s thesis explored how data localization policies affect global cloud infrastructure and data center placement, combining large-scale datasets with econometric analysis.

I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Data Science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi), including an exchange semester at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au). My Bachelor’s thesis focused on machine learning for personalized treatment decision-making.
