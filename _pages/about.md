Hello and thank you for stopping by!

As a student, I enjoy learning new things and taking on different challenges to be better every day. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Aalto University, I got a chance to satisfy my intellectual curiosity by encountering novel concepts ranging from more technology-focused such as programming, databases, and artificial intelligence to more business-focused such as economics every day. Throughout my study, I have always maintained an excellent performance, hence leading to my work as a teaching assistant for 5 computer science courses at my university. I truly love this experience as it has certainly sharpened my knowledge and developed my communication, interpersonal, and empathy skills.


In my future career, my heartfelt ambition is to harness the power of data and software, merging my skills and passion to create impactful solutions. I aspire to not only meet but surpass industry standards by innovatively leveraging data insights and cutting-edge software engineering. Beyond the technicalities, my genuine motivation lies in contributing to positive societal change through the transformative potential of data-driven applications. The prospect of crafting solutions that address real-world challenges excites me, and I am genuinely eager to immerse myself in the dynamic realms of data-related and software engineering. It's the fusion of technical expertise with a sincere commitment to social responsibility that propels me forward. 

With a distinct passion for technology and an insatiable eagerness to learn and collaborate, I am wholeheartedly open to exploring opportunities in data-related, software engineering, and research roles. My goal is to gain hands-on experience and cultivate crucial skills in these dynamic fields. If you share a similar enthusiasm for innovation and growth,  connect with me on LinkedIn or drop me a message at linh.l.ngo@aalto.fi. I would genuinely love to engage in a conversation about the exciting possibilities that lie ahead. Let's connect and explore the vast landscape of technology together!
