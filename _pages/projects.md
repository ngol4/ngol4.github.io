## Machine Learning for Personalized Treatment Decision-Making
**Key concepts and Tools**- * Causal Inference | Reinforcement Learning | Literature Review | Research*

This is the bachelor's thesis for my Data Science degree at Aalto University.

Abstract

Treatments are rarely effective for all patients, and under all circumstances. A treatment
that works for one patient may not be applied to others, and a treatment that works
for one earlier may not be effective later (e.g. due to drug resistance). Since there is
no one-size-fits-all way to treatment, personalized treatment by incorporating patient
characteristics and tailoring the patient needs into treatment decisions appears as a
transformative approach to healthcare.

In general, clinical experts usually have to make decisions about whether to prescribe a
treatment to a patient or not. To determine the best treatment to administer to a patient,
information about the treatment effects of each possible treatment actions is required.
The problem of estimating treatment effects can be formulated as a causal inference
problem, and machine learning-based methods for causal inference can be utilized to
estimate individualized treatment effects.

Moreover, healthcare decisions also include the search for treatment regimes that
yield the best outcome in all states of a patient’s disease. Those regimes work in a
dynamic fashion as the patient’s state has to be updated over time with regards to
the progression of the disease. Reinforcement learning with the main mechanism of
feedback and improvement has strong potential to learn dynamic treatment regimes,
thus reinforcement learning methods are usually applied to derive an optimal treatment
strategy in the time-varying and dynamic setting.

This thesis is a literature review which aims to study and compare two different ma-
chine learning approaches for personalized treatment decision-making: causal inference
for individualized treatment effects estimation and reinforcement learning for optimal
dynamic treatment regimes estimation. For each approach, background knowledge, the
objective, the overview of data sources, machine learning methods, evaluation methods,
and applications in recent years are introduced.

This thesis concludes that both approaches show great potential in providing personal-
ized treatment recommendations and transforming healthcare. However, there are still
some limitations that need to be addressed to make more interpretable and trustful deci-
sions. One suggestion would be to take advantage of the capabilities of both approaches
and incorporate causal model into the learning process of reinforcement learning.
